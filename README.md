# XMC7000 MCU: CAN FD

This code example demonstrates how to use controller area network flexible data-rate (CAN FD) in XMC7000 MCU devices. In this example, the CAN Node-1 sends a CAN FD or standard frame to CAN Node-2 on pressing the user button and vice versa. Both the CAN nodes log the received data over UART serial terminal. Each time a CAN frame is received, the user LED toggles.

</details>

<details><summary><b>Use Project Creator CLI</b></summary>

The 'project-creator-cli' tool can be used to create applications from a CLI terminal or from within batch files or shell scripts. This tool is available in the *{ModusToolbox&trade; install directory}/tools_{version}/project-creator/* directory.

Use a CLI terminal to invoke the 'project-creator-cli' tool. On Windows, use the command-line 'modus-shell' program provided in the ModusToolbox&trade; installation instead of a standard Windows command-line application. This shell provides access to all ModusToolbox&trade; tools. You can access it by typing "modus-shell" in the search box in the Windows menu. In Linux and macOS, you can use any terminal application.

The following example will clone the "[mtb-example-pdl-xmc7000-canfd](https://github.com/Infineon/mtb-example-pdl-xmc7000-canfd)" application with the desired name "MyCANFD" configured for the *KIT_XMC72_EVK* BSP into the specified working directory, *C:/mtb_projects*:

   ```
   project-creator-cli --board-id KIT_XMC72_EVK --app-id mtb-example-pdl-xmc7000-canfd --user-app-name MyCANFD --target-dir "C:/mtb_projects"
   ```
The 'project-creator-cli' tool has the following arguments:

Argument | Description | Required/optional
---------|-------------|-----------
`--board-id` | Defined in the <id> field of the [BSP](https://github.com/Infineon?q=bsp-manifest&type=&language=&sort=) manifest | Required
`--app-id`   | Defined in the <id> field of the [CE](https://github.com/Infineon?q=ce-manifest&type=&language=&sort=) manifest | Required
`--target-dir`| Specify the directory in which the application is to be created if you prefer not to use the default current working directory | Optional
`--user-app-name`| Specify the name of the application if you prefer to have a name other than the example's default name | Optional

> **Note:** The project-creator-cli tool uses the `git clone` and `make getlibs` commands to fetch the repository and import the required libraries. For details, see the "Project creator tools" section of the [ModusToolbox&trade; tools package user guide](https://www.infineon.com/ModusToolboxUserGuide) (locally available at {ModusToolbox&trade; install directory}/docs_{version}/mtb_user_guide.pdf).

## Operation


1. Connect the CAN pins of the [Supported kits](#supported-kits-make-variable-target) using the instructions in the [Hardware setup](#hardware-setup) section.

2. Connect the CAN Node-1 kit to your PC using the provided USB cable through the KitProg3 USB connector.

3. Program the board using one of the following:

   <details><summary><b>Using Eclipse IDE</b></summary>

      1. Select the application project in the Project Explorer.

      2. In the **Quick Panel**, scroll down, and click **\<Application Name> Program (KitProg3_MiniProg4)**.
   </details>


   <details><summary><b>In other IDEs</b></summary>

   Follow the instructions in your preferred IDE.
   </details>


   <details><summary><b>Using CLI</b></summary>

     From the terminal, execute the `make program` command to build and program the application using the default toolchain to the default target. The default toolchain is specified in the application's Makefile but you can override this value manually:
      ```
      make program TOOLCHAIN=<toolchain>
      ```

      Example:
      ```
      make program TOOLCHAIN=GCC_ARM
      ```
   </details>

4. Connect the CAN Node-2 kit to your PC using the provided USB cable through the KitProg3 USB connector. Open the *main.c* file and set the `USE_CAN_NODE` macro to `CAN_NODE_2`, and follow **Step 3**.

5. Press button SW2 from CAN Node-1, for transmission of frame from CAN Node-1 to CAN Node-2 and vice-versa.

6. Observe the results in the terminal window.

    **Figure 1. Sample output with the CAN FD data reception**

    ![](images/canfd_output.png)

**Note:** This example demonstrates how to use CAN FD by default, you can change this example to transmit and receive the CAN standard frame: open the *main.c* file and set the `USE_CAN_MODE` macro to `CAN_CLASSIC_MODE`, and follow **Step 3**.

## Debugging

You can debug the example to step through the code.


<details><summary><b>In Eclipse IDE</b></summary>

Use the **\<Application Name> Debug (KitProg3_MiniProg4)** configuration in the **Quick Panel**. For details, see the "Program and debug" section in the [Eclipse IDE for ModusToolbox&trade; user guide](https://www.infineon.com/MTBEclipseIDEUserGuide).

<mark> Add the below Note for relevant CEs only, like PSoC 6 MCU based. Remove this note for others.

> **Note:** **(Only while debugging)** On the CM4 CPU, some code in `main()` may execute before the debugger halts at the beginning of `main()`. This means that some code executes twice – once before the debugger stops execution, and again after the debugger resets the program counter to the beginning of `main()`. See [KBA231071](https://community.infineon.com/docs/DOC-21143) to learn about this and for the workaround.
